<title>Using Web Runner</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Running generic stories via a web-based interface</h2>

<p>The Web Runner provides a simple web-based interface to running
generic stories. A typical use case is for BAs, QAs or stakeholders to
be able to access the results of story running without needing access to
developer resources, e.g. source control or build systems.</p>

<p>A fully functional example webapp is provided in <a
	href="http://git.codehaus.org/gitweb.cgi?p=jbehave-web.git;a=tree;f=examples/trader-runner">trader
runner example</a>. We'll be using this example to illustrate the use of Web
Runner:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="customising-web-runner.html">Customise Web Runner</a></li>
	<li>Deploy webapp to your favourite webapp container</li>
	<li>Open page <b>http://localhost:8080/trader-runner</b> (assuming
	normal port conventions)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Run Story</h2>

<p>The Run Story page allows the user to run any textual story and
to display the result in the same page.</p>

<ul>
	<li>From Menu, click on <b>Run Story</b>, which will take you to a
	page where you can enter your textual story.</li>
	<li>Input textual story in textarea (e.g you can cut &amp; paste
	a scenario found in the <a
		href="http://git.codehaus.org/gitweb.cgi?p=jbehave-web.git;a=blob;f=examples/trader-runner/src/main/resources/trader.scenario">trader
	scenario</a>) and click on <b>Run</b> button.</li>
	<li>Upon execution, the output of the story is shown below. By
	default the same output is shown as the one you would see when running
	JBehave via a command-line interface. This includes any details of
	failed and pending steps. If any failures occur, the user has the stack
	trace in an expandable section below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Find Steps</h2>

<p>The Find Steps page allows the user to find steps (i.e. methods
in steps instances classes) and to display the patterns and the
associated methods.</p>

<ul>
	<li>From Menu, click on <b>Find Steps</b>, which will take you to
	a page where you can enter your textual step.</li>
	<li>Input textual step in textarea (e.g you can cut &amp; paste a
	step from the scenario found in the <a
		href="http://git.codehaus.org/gitweb.cgi?p=jbehave-web.git;a=blob;f=examples/trader-runner/src/main/resources/trader.scenario">trader
	scenario</a>) and click on <b>Find</b> button.</li>
	<li>A blank input will simply show all the steps that are
	configured.</li>
	<li>Upon execution, the steps found are shown below. By default,
	only the patterns are shown, but you can choose to also display
	associated methods.</li>
	<li>The final section shows the steps instances that were
	configured and were used to find steps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Files</h2>

<p>The Data Files page allows the user to upload and view any data
file that may be used during the execution of the story. Data files can
be either single text files or zip archives. If archives, these are
automatically unzipped when upload to the server.</p>

<ul>
	<li>From Menu, click on <b>Data Files</b>, which will take you to
	a page where you can view the files already uploaded to the upload
	directory (defaults to "/tmp/upload" but is configurable via the <a
		href="javadoc/web-runner/org/jbehave/web/runner/wicket/WebRunnerApplication.html#uploadDirectory()">WebRunnerApplication#uploadDirectory()</a>).</li>
	<li>Use the <b>Browse</b> and <b>Upload</b> buttons to upload any
	file to the upload directory.</li>
	<li>Use the <b>Show Content</b> and <b>Hide Content</b> buttons to
	toggle display of uploaded file content.</li>
	<li>Click on <b>View</b> link next to the files to view their
	content.</li>
	<li>Use the <b>Delete</b> button to delete any selected files.</li>
</ul>
