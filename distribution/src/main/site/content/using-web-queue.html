    <h2>Running story asynchronously via a web-based queue</h2>

    <p>
        The <a
            href="javadoc/web-selenium/org/jbehave/web/queue/WebQueue.html">WebQueue</a>
        provides a simple standalone web-based way to input and run
        generic stories in an asynchronous way. It uses an embedded
        Jetty server to provide a listener on a simple input page that
        allow the submission of a story to enqueue. For each story
        enqueued a timestamped job is generated and the results are
        viewable in the story navigator. A typical use case is for BAs,
        QAs or stakeholders to be able to multiple stories asyncronously
        and then view the collective results in the story navigator.
    </p>
    <p>
        The WebQueue can be configured via the <a
            href="javadoc/web-selenium/org/jbehave/web/queue/WebQueueConfiguration.html">WebQueueConfiguration</a>,
        which allows the specification of the web port, the names of the
        input and navigator page, as well as the navigator directory.
        The story navigator needs to <a
            href="http://paul-hammant.github.com/StoryNavigator/downloads.html">downloaded</a>
        and installed in a local directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        A fully functional example webapp is provided in <a
            href="https://github.com/jbehave/jbehave-tutorial/tree/master/etsy-stories">JBehave
            Tutorial </a>. The Web Queue can be activated via the system
        property <b>WEB_QUEUE</b> and the input page can be accessed via
        the URL <b>http://localhost:8090</b>.
