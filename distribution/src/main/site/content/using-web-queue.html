<h2>Running story asynchronously via a web-based queue</h2>

<p>The Web Queue provides a simple standalone web-based queue to running
generic stories in an asynchronous way. It uses an embedded Jetty server to provide
a listener on a simple welcome page that allow the submission of a story to enqueue.
A typical use case is for BAs, QAs or stakeholders to be able to multiple stories 
asyncronously and then view the results in the story navigator.</p>
